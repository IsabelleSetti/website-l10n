TRLM 8635A - Website Localization
============================

###Syllabus

**Instructor:** Nathan Suitter  
**Email:** TBD  
**Location:** Morse B104  
**Office Hours:** TBD  

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with localization in a web development envirmonment. The role that we'd like to focus on is that of a localization project manager at web application company. 

We will favor hands-on learning, with the priority being similar to what it is "in the wild"--to ship software. The hands-on style of this course will put students in situations that require critical thinking, risk mitigation skills and solid knowledge of the web localization industry--all of which they can hope to hone throughout this class.

Specifically, we will be covering the following topics: version control, how to use the Unix-based command line, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, how to localize a ruby app, continuous localization strategies, localization testing, and how to fit localization into the agile framework.

The work will be split into weekly assignments, in-class quizzes and a final project. Students are expected to complete their assignments and actively participate in class.
